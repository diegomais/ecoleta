## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, and Xcode.

#### Node, Watchman, JDK

We recommend installing Node, Watchman, and JDK using Homebrew. Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

```
brew install node
brew install watchman
brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
brew cask install adoptopenjdk8
```

If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 8.3 or newer.

Watchman is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.

If you have already installed JDK on your system, make sure it is JDK 8 or newer.

#### React Native CLI

Node comes with npm, which lets you install the React Native command line interface.

Run the following command in a Terminal:

```
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

#### Xcode

The easiest way to install Xcode is via the Mac App Store. Installing Xcode will also install the iOS Simulator and all the necessary tools to build your iOS app.

If you have already installed Xcode on your system, make sure it is version 9.4 or newer.

##### Command Line Tools

You will also need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Open Xcode, then choose "Preferences..." from the Xcode menu. Go to the Locations panel and install the tools by selecting the most recent version in the Command Line Tools dropdown.
